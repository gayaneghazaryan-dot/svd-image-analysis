This repository provides a complete, reproducible implementation of **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** methods for **image compression**, **denoising**, **benchmarking**, and **dimensionality reduction (PCA)**.  
It accompanies the article:

> **SVDlab: A Reproducible Toolkit for SVD-based Image Compression, Denoising, and PCA with Adaptive Rank Selection**  
> *Ghazaryan, G. & Ghazaryan, A.* (2025).  
> Submitted to the *Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)*, 2025.

## 🔧 Installation

Platform note:  
- On **macOS/Linux**, use `python3` (and `python3 -m pip …`).  
- On **Windows**, use `py -3` (or `python`) for all commands below.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/gayaneghazaryan-dot/svd-image-analysis.git
cd svd-image-analysis

# Create an isolated environment and install dependencies
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

# Optional dependency (for elbow detection)
python3 -m pip install kneed
```

If `kneed` is not installed, the code automatically falls back to the energy-based rule.  
Python ≥ 3.10 is required (tested on Python 3.13 under Windows/macOS/Linux).

## 🚀 Usage

The toolkit consists of four self-contained scripts.  
Each reproduces all figures and tables for one of the main tasks.  
Outputs are written to `results/Figures/` and `results/Tables/`.

```bash
# 1) Image compression
python3 code/svd_compression_merged.py

# 2) Image denoising
python3 code/svd_denoising.py

# 3) Factorization benchmarks
python3 code/benchmark_and_plots.py

# 4) PCA with adaptive component selection
python3 code/pca_adaptive_combined.py
```

Each command regenerates all required figures and tables, allowing reviewers to reproduce the article’s results from a clean environment.

<details>
<summary>Optional: Advanced CLI arguments (not required for JOSS reproduction)</summary>

```bash
# Use a different built-in image
python3 code/benchmark_and_plots.py --input=camera

# Resize before processing (HxW)
python3 code/benchmark_and_plots.py --resize=256x256

# Add noise and benchmark on noisy input
python3 code/benchmark_and_plots.py --use_noisy --sigma=0.10

# Change adaptive energy threshold and strategies
python3 code/benchmark_and_plots.py --energy=0.995 --strategies energy elbow
```

## 📂 Outputs

```
results/
 ├── Figures/   → publication-quality plots
 └── Tables/    → CSV/LaTeX tables with PSNR, SSIM, runtime, PCA variance, etc.
```

Example outputs are provided under `examples/` for illustration:

- **examples/Figures/** — sample plots (compression, denoising, PCA, benchmarking)  
- **examples/Tables/** — representative CSV file with PSNR/SSIM metrics  

These examples demonstrate the structure and appearance of the automatically generated outputs.  
All full results can be reproduced by running the four Python scripts above.

## ✨ Features

- **Adaptive rank selection** — combines cumulative-energy thresholds with Kneedle-based elbow detection  
- **Unified benchmarking** — transparent comparisons of SVD, EVD, and QR under identical conditions  
- **Cross-domain applications** — supports image compression, denoising, and PCA-based dimensionality reduction  
- **Reproducibility by design** — deterministic results, fixed random seeds, and pinned dependencies

## 🔁 Reproducing Figures and Tables

All figures and tables presented in the paper are generated automatically by the four Python scripts in the `code/` folder.  
Each script creates its own subdirectories under `results/Figures/` and `results/Tables/`, containing all publication-ready outputs in PDF, CSV, and LaTeX formats.

No pre-generated results are stored in the repository to ensure reproducibility and lightweight version control.  
After installation, simply run:

```bash
python3 code/svd_compression_merged.py
python3 code/svd_denoising.py
python3 code/benchmark_and_plots.py
python3 code/pca_adaptive_combined.py
```

This will regenerate the full set of figures and tables exactly as referenced in the JOSS manuscript.  
Each run is deterministic and environment-controlled via fixed random seeds and version-pinned dependencies.
