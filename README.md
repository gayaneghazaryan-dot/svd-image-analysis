# 📘 SVD Image Analysis Toolkit

This repository provides a complete, reproducible implementation of **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** methods for  
image compression, denoising, benchmarking, and dimensionality reduction (PCA).  
It accompanies the article:

> **SVDlab: A Reproducible Toolkit for SVD-based Image Compression, Denoising, and PCA with Adaptive Rank Selection**  
> Submitted to the *Journal of Open Source Software (JOSS)*, 2025.

## 🔧 Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gayaneghazaryan-dot/svd-image-analysis.git
cd svd-image-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
> 💡 **Tip:**  
> All experiments were executed in a virtual environment named `myenv`.  
> To reproduce the same setup:
> ```bash
> python -m venv myenv
> source myenv/bin/activate
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> ```

Python ≥ 3.9 is required (tested on Python 3.13, Windows/macOS/Linux).

## 🚀 Usage

The toolkit consists of **four scripts**.  
Each script is self-contained and regenerates all figures and tables for a specific task.  
Outputs are written to `results/Figures/` and `results/Tables/`.

```bash
# 1) Compression (default built-in "astronaut" image)
python code/svd_compression_merged.py

# 2) Denoising (default built-in "astronaut" image with default noise level)
python code/svd_denoising.py

# 3) Factorization benchmarks and plots (default "astronaut" and builtin "camera")
python code/benchmark_and_plots.py
python code/benchmark_and_plots.py --input=camera

# 4) PCA with adaptive component selection (default Iris dataset)
python code/pca_adaptive_combined.py

```

Each command automatically regenerates all required figures and tables under `results/`,  
allowing reviewers or users to fully reproduce the article’s results from a clean environment.

## 📂 Outputs

- `results/Figures/` → Publication-quality plots  
- `results/Tables/` → CSV tables with PSNR, SSIM, runtime, PCA variance, etc.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Adaptive rank selection** — combines energy thresholding and elbow detection for robust SVD truncation.  
- **Unified benchmarking** — transparent comparisons of SVD, EVD, and QR under identical conditions.  
- **Cross-domain applications** — supports image compression, denoising, and PCA-based dimensionality reduction.

🔁 Reproducing Figures and Tables

All figures and tables presented in the paper are generated automatically by the four Python scripts located in the code/ folder.
Each script creates its own subdirectories under results/Figures/ and results/Tables/, containing all publication-ready outputs in PDF, CSV, and LaTeX formats.

No pre-generated results are stored in the repository to ensure reproducibility and lightweight version control.
After installation, simply run:

python code/svd_compression_merged.py
python code/svd_denoising.py
python code/benchmark_and_plots.py
python code/pca_adaptive_combined.py


This will regenerate the full set of figures and tables exactly as used in the manuscript.
Each run is deterministic and environment-controlled via fixed random seeds and version-pinned dependencies.
